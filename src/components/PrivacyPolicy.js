Cookies are mainly used to adapt the operation of the App to your expectations, offering a more personalized browsing experience and memorizing the choices you made previously.

            Third-party cookies: We may also utilize third-party cookies, which are cookies sent by a third-party to your computer. Permanent cookies are often third-party cookies. The majority of third-party cookies consist of tracking cookies used to identify online behavior, understand interests and then customize advertising for users.

They are sent from the domains of the aforementioned third parties external to the App. Third-party analytical cookies are used to detect information on user behavior on our App. This place anonymously, in order to monitor the performance and improve the usability of the App. Third-party profiling cookies are used to create profiles relating to users, in order to propose advertising in line with the choices expressed by the users themselves.

            The aforementioned information is processed in an automated form and collected in an exclusively aggregated manner in order to verify the correct functioning of the App, and for security reasons. This information will be processed according to the legitimate interests of the Data Controller.
            For security purposes (spam filters, firewalls, virus detection), the automatically recorded data may also possibly include Personal Data such as IP address, which could be used, in accordance with applicable laws, in order to block attempts at damage to the App or damage to other users, or in the case of harmful activities or crime.
